# GitLab Scripts
This folder contains helpers from GitLab. There is no need to install Ruby or run the validators in production. These scripts are here to assist during development.

## Set-up
Before using the `validate.rb` script. You will first need to install ruby.

> You can do so on MacOS with `brew install rbenv ruby-build` to install the Ruby version manager [(`rbenv`)](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

## Usage
You should be able to run the `validate.rb` script after installing a valid Ruby version.

```
ruby validate.rb sast-report-format_15-0-7.json gl-sast-report_21-05-23.json
```

See GitLab's [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html#validate-locally) for more info.
